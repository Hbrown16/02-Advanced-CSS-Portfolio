# Week 2 Homework
[Deployed Link]

## Assignment Description
This Homework assignment we had to create our own HTML code and CSS code as well. This assignment was created to help us get used to CSS and Flex in CSS. It was challenging to say the least.

For this assignment I focused on creating something that I can slowly start to recreate as I gain more skills and to expand my portfolia over time.

I created 3 sections "About Me, "work", "Contact me" and I have links at the top of my site to direct you to those sections

## Acceptance Criteria
    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
